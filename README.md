# Wox.Plugin.Volume
Control the system volume with [Wox](http://www.getwox.com/).

## Usage
Keyword: `vol`

Type `+` to increase the volume, `-` to decrease the volume, and `m` to mute. If you type something like `++-`, it will increase twice, and decrease once!
The increase/decrease step, and the keys to control the volume can be configured: just edit the `config.json` file and restart Wox.

You can also change the style: default style (`percent`) shows a percentage; `bar` will show a ASCII volume bar.

## Download
Get it from [WPM](http://www.getwox.com/plugin/72) or the [downloads pages](https://github.com/rohm1/wox.plugin.volume/releases/latest).

## Gift

## About
- I don't have sound keys at work..
- The CoreAudio DLL comes from [here](http://whenimbored.xfx.net/download-links/?did=5). I just had to recompile it for .NET 3.5 since it is compiled for .NET 4.
